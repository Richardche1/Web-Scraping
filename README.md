# Web-Scraping
This is my second personal project. I'm always interested in scraping information from websites.
For this project, I want to scrape the listings from StreetEasy and compare the housing prices in different neighborhoods of Brooklyn.

Jesse Steinweg-Woods's blog "Web Scraping Indeed for Key Data Science Job Skills" gave me the motivation and inspiration on this project.
His website also has other projects that are very readworthy to a data science novice like me.

I also visited https://github.com/ChrisMuir
his project on web scraping helped me complete this project.

web_scraping_streeteasy.ipynb has all the functions that are necessary to navigating to StreetEasy website, parsing the HTML, and extracting all the relevant infomation.

runfile_streeteasy.ipynb detail the steps of gathering the scraped data, putting the data into a dataframe, and conducting analysis.
